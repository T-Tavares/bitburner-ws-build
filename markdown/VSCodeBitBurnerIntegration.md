# BitBurner - My Build and Progress

I recently discovered BitBurner and quickly fell in love with it.

I wanted to take things a step further by integrating the game with **VS Code** and **TypeScript**, so I could build scripts in a more structured and scalable way. This repo documents my setup, issues I ran into, and how I solved them

Hopefully it helps other players too.

## (New Method) WebSockets on MacOS Steam

[Link for Template Official Repo](https://github.com/shyguy1412/bb-external-editor#)

They do have all the instructions there, but I'll just sum up here.

### Getting ready

Start by cloning the repo and running npm install

```
https://github.com/shyguy1412/bb-external-editor#
```

```
npm install && npm install esbuild-bitburner-plugin@latest
```

### On Steam

go into the properties for Bitburner (little cogwheel to the right when viewing Bitburner in your library) and add the following launch option --remote-debugging-port=9222

```
--remote-debugging-port=9222
```

### Turning WS On and Connecting

On your terminal run

```
npm start
```

Open then game and go to the Remote API menu and add the settings:

Options > Remote API

```
Hostname: localhost
Port: 12525
Reconnection delay: 0
Use wss: off ( I believe is better on but for me only worked with it off)
```

Hit connect
You should see a `Status Online` and you are all set.

# (Legacy) Old Remote API on MacOS Steam

## Using VS Code and Typescript

I’m using macOS with the Steam version of BitBurner. Getting the **Remote API** and the **TypeScript template** working was not straightforward at first, so I’m documenting everything here.

### My Setup

```
MacOS
Steam Bitburner
```

### Connecting to VSCode

The provided link to the api [Remote API Documentation](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/src/Documentation/doc/programming/remote_api.md) was returning me a 404 page.

After some searching, I found that the correct setup should use:

```
Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: 12525
WWS: ON
```

#### Erros and Issues

However, attempting to connect resulted in the error below:

```
Remote API connection closed

Error with websocket ws://localhost:0, details: {"isTrusted":true}

Error with websocket wss://127.0.0.1:12525, details: {"isTrusted":true}
```

I've also tried on a couple different browsers (Arc and Chrome) and still got the same error.

I believe it's because I'm on a MacOS (Not sure). But the Options > Remote API menu only shows status offline for me and there's no option to turn it on, Just connect. Which fails

#### What worked for me - Typescript

If you **are NOT** planning on using Typescript you can skipp this section. I've noticed that completing the Typescript setup steps before connect VS Code to BitBurner avoid silent errors.

---

I've used the template from the official repo [Typescript template for Bitburner's Remote File API](https://github.com/bitburner-official/typescript-template)

But that through a few errors, mainly outdated external repos complaining about new ones.

#### IMPORTANT

```
Another important thing on MacOS is; By default the OS Desktop syncs with iCloud. That combined with the watch features can cause files to get overwriten or duplicate.

Best approach here is to move your files to ~/BitBurner or any other place that does not sync with iCloud automatically.
```

1. Clone the template repo for your intended BitBurner folder

For SSH

```
git clone git@github.com:bitburner-official/typescript-template.git .
```

For HTTPS

```
git clone https://github.com/bitburner-official/typescript-template.git .
```

2. Add "ignoreDeprecations": "6.0" to tsconfig Compiler Options (As advised on VS Code Error Warning)

```
   ...
   "compilerOptions": {
        "ignoreDeprecations": "6.0",
         ...
```

3. Copy the file [NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/src/ScriptEditor/NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts) to your BitBurner folder

4. Update Typescript version

```
npm i typescript@latest
```

4. Make sure the extension has the watch turned on and the settings are on vscode workspace

    ( If you don't want it you can manually push files on the dist folder by right clicking on a text are on the file, but that's tedious )

5. Now we just need a couple of NPM installs lodash + lodash types and date-fns + date-fns types

```
npm i lodash && npm i -D @types/lodash
npm install date-fns && npm install -D @types/date-fns
```

With that out of the way, we can now connect VS Code Extension to BitBurner

#### What worked for me - Remote API Connection

1. Install [Bitburner VSCode Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bitburner.bitburner-vscode-integration) extension on VS Code

2. Turn on Server and Autostart on Bitburner and get the your API Key. You won't find it through the Game Options but actually through the API Server Option on MacOS Menu (Top of your screen)

```
Enable Server
Enable Autostart
Copy Auth Token
```

3. Update the VS Code Extension Settings with API key you just copied and set the script root folder to "./dist"

    IMPORTANT: The watch feature only work if you set it up on the workstation, you can ignore the "User" settings and go directly to the "Workstation"

```
Bitburner: Auth Token (Token generated by the game client (You just copied))
Bitburner › File Watcher: Enable
Bitburner: Script Root : "./dist"

# Not Necessary - But the errors and notifications helped me sorting the issue

Bitburner: Show File Watcher Enabled Notification: Enable
Bitburner: Show Push Success Notification: Enable
```

Once the whole setup is done you'll have to run `npm run watch` so typescript can be compiled and pushed to BitBurner automatically.
You should see something like that on your terminal:

```
    [watch:local]
    [watch:local] > bitburner-typescript-template@2.0.0 watch:local
    [watch:local] > node build/watch.js
    [watch:local]
    [watch:remote]
    [watch:remote] > bitburner-typescript-template@2.0.0 watch:remote
    [watch:remote] > bitburner-filesync
    [watch:remote]
    [watch:transpile]
    [watch:transpile] > bitburner-typescript-template@2.0.0 watch:transpile
    [watch:transpile] > tsc -w --preserveWatchOutput
    [watch:transpile]
    [watch:remote] Watching folder /Users/your-username/BitBurner/dist
    [watch:remote] Server is ready, running on 12525!
    [watch:local] Start watching static and ts files...
    [watch:local] /lib changed
    [watch:transpile] [time] Starting compilation in watch mode...
    [watch:transpile]
    [watch:transpile] [time] Found 0 errors. Watching for file changes.
    [watch:transpile]
    [watch:remote] template.js changed
```

### Still Having Issues

If you are still having issues after that try:

1. Close BitBurner and VS Code
2. Delete your node_modules and package-lock.json and run npm install

```
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm init
```

3. Reopen VS Code and BitBurner
4. Run `npm run watch`
